<h1>Priyanka Snips a play</h1>
<h5>Author : Sir James M. Barrie</h5>
<h5>playname :THE TWELVE-POUND LOOK</h5>
<p>She taps him on the shoulder with a paper-knife and
     says huskily: "Rise, Sir Harry." He rises, bows, and glides about
     the room, going on his knees to various articles of furniture, and
     rises from each a knight. It is a radiant domestic scene, and_
     HARRY _is as dignified as if he knew that royalty was rehearsing it
     at the other end_.</p>
<p><h5>
    SIR HARRY.</h5> [_Complacently._] Did that seem all right, eh?</p><br>
    
    <p><h5>LADY SIMS.</h5> [_Much relieved._] I think perfect.</p><br>
    
        <p><h5>SIR HARRY.</h5>  But was it dignified?</p><br>
    
            <p><h5> LADY SIMS.</h5>  Oh, very. And it will be still more so when you have the
    sword.</p><br>
    
    <p><h5> SIR HARRY.</h5>  The sword will lend it an air. There are really the five
    moments--[_suiting the action to the word_]--the glide--the dip--the
    kiss--the tap--and you back out a knight. It's short, but it's a very
    beautiful ceremony. [_Kindly._] Anything you can suggest?</p><br>
    
    <p><h5></h5>LADY SIMS.</h5>  No--oh, no. [_Nervously, seeing him pause to kiss the tassel
    of a cushion._] You don't think you have practised till you know what to
    do almost too well?</p><br>
    
         [_He has been in a blissful temper, but such niggling criticism
         would try any man._
    
         <p><h5>SIR HARRY.</h5>  I do not. Don't talk nonsense. Wait till your opinion is
    asked for.</p><br>
    
    <p><h5>LADY SIMS.</h5>  [_Abashed._] I'm sorry, Harry. [_A perfect butler appears and
    presents a card._] "The Flora Typewriting Agency."</p><br>
    
    <p><h5>SIR HARRY.</h5>  Ah, yes. I telephoned them to send some one. A woman, I
    suppose, Tombes?</p><br>
    
    TOMBES. Yes, Sir Harry.
    
    <p><h5>SIR HARRY.</h5>  Show her in here. [_He has very lately become a stickler for
    etiquette._] And, Tombes, strictly speaking, you know, I am not Sir
    Harry till Thursday.</p><br>
    
    TOMBES. Beg pardon, sir, but it is such a satisfaction to us.
    
    <p><h5>SIR HARRY.</h5>  [_Good-naturedly._] Ah, they like it down-stairs, do they?</p><br>
    
    TOMBES. [_Unbending._] Especially the females, Sir Harry.
    
    <p><h5>SIR HARRY.</h5>  Exactly. You can show her in, Tombes. [_The butler departs on
    his mighty task._] You can tell the woman what she is wanted for, Emmy,
    while I change. [_He is too modest to boast about himself, and prefers
    to keep a wife in the house for that purpose._] You can tell her the
    sort of things about me that will come better from you. [_Smiling
    happily._] You heard what Tombes said: "Especially the females." And he
    is right. Success! The women like it even better than the men. And
    rightly. For they share. _You_ share, _Lady_ Sims. Not a woman will see
    that gown without being sick with envy of it. I know them. Have all our
    lady friends in to see it. It will make them ill for a week.</p><br>
    
         [_These sentiments carry him off light-heartedly, and presently the
         disturbing element is shown in. She is a mere typist, dressed in
         uncommonly good taste, but at contemptibly small expense, and she
         is carrying her typewriter in a friendly way rather than as a badge
         of slavery, as of course it is. Her eye is clear; and in odd
         contrast to_ LADY SIMS, _she is self-reliant and serene_.
        
    KATE. [_Respectfully, but she should have waited to be spoken to._] Good
    morning, madam.
    
    <p><h5> LADY SIMS.</h5>  [_In her nervous way, and scarcely noticing that the typist
    is a little too ready with her tongue._] Good morning. [_As a first
    impression she rather likes the woman, and the woman, though it is
    scarcely worth mentioning, rather likes her._ LADY SIMS _has a maid for
    buttoning and unbuttoning her, and probably another for waiting on the
    maid, and she gazes with a little envy perhaps at a woman who does
    things for herself_.] Is that the typewriting machine?</h5></p>
