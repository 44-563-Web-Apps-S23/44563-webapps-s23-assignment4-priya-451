<h2>Author : Sir James M. Barrie</h2>
<h2>playname :THE TWELVE-POUND LOOK</h2>
<p>SIR HARRY. [_Complacently._] Did that seem all right, eh?<p><br>
    
    LADY SIMS. [_Much relieved._] I think perfect.
    
<p>SIR HARRY. But was it dignified?</p><br>
    
    <p>LADY SIMS. Oh, very. And it will be still more so when you have the sword.</p><br>
    
   <p> SIR HARRY. The sword will lend it an air. There are really the five
    moments--[_suiting the action to the word_]--the glide--the dip--the
    kiss--the tap--and you back out a knight. It's short, but it's a very
    beautiful ceremony. [_Kindly._] Anything you can suggest?</p><br>
    
    <p>LADY SIMS. No--oh, no. [_Nervously, seeing him pause to kiss the tassel
    of a cushion._] You don't think you have practised till you know what to
    do almost too well?</p><br>
    
    <p>He has been in a blissful temper, but such niggling criticism would try any man.</p><br>
    
    <p>SIR HARRY. I do not. Don't talk nonsense. Wait till your opinion is
    asked for.</p>
